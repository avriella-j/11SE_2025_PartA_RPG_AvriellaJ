# Space Station RPG Development Log

## Day 1: Project Blueprint
Started with the basics:
- Created README.md and ROADMAP.md to outline my vision
- Set up the project structure with code and docs folders
- Brainstormed the core game mechanics and flow

## Day 2: Item System Foundation
Created the base StationItem class:
- Added name and description attributes
- Implemented examine() method for item descriptions
- Decided to use inheritance for item types

Then, DiagnosticTool:
- Made it inherit from StationItem
- Added hints about its purpose
- Planned how it would interact with the droid

Then, EnergyCrystal:
- Created as another StationItem subclass
- Added descriptions of its unstable energy
- Made it the main objective item

## Day 3: World Building
Built the Location system:
- Created attributes for name, description, and exits
- Added flags for item presence and droid blocking
- Implemented methods for movement and item collection

## Day 4: NPC Development
Created the DamagedMaintenanceDroid:
- Made it block passage initially
- Added repair functionality
- Implemented blocking state tracking

## Day 5: Player System
Developed the Player class:
- Added location tracking and item possession
- Implemented score and hazard counting
- Created movement and item interaction methods

## Day 6: Game Control
Built the GameController:
- Connected all game objects
- Implemented the main game loop
- Added command processing
- Set up win conditions

## Day 7: Code Organization
- Moved utility classes to utils/ folder
- Added logging system for better tracking
- Created requirements.txt
- Implemented error handling
- Added comprehensive documentation

## Day 8: UI Improvements
Enhanced the game interface:
- Added welcome screen with command list to main.py
- Implemented screen clearing for better visibility
- Added "Press Enter to begin" prompt
- Improved command display format
- Separated welcome message from game loop

## Reflections
The project evolved from a simple idea to a complex system:
- Modular architecture following PEP8 guidelines
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- Type hints for code clarity

Each day brought new challenges and learning opportunities. The most challenging part was creating the interconnected systems while maintaining code readability and maintainability.

The journey continues as I refine and expand the game mechanics.
